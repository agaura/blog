&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Howdy! My name is Alex and I'm currently a master's student in a program called [IMLEX](https://imlex.org/) where I'm currently completing a thesis at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in GjÃ¸vik, Norway.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This website mostly functions as a way for me to teach myself and strengthen my understanding of what I like to study, as well as provide a space in which some of my projects can live. I'm mostly interested in how we represent our perception and how we approximate and model it, so these days, that translates to studying color.
